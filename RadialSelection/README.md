# TechViews
Custom Android UI Elements

- Look at the attrs.xml file to see what values you can use to populate the view

- Just add views to the RadialSelection like you would any other RelativeLayout 
  except mark the center_icon with an id so the view ignores it, if no image is marked it
  will use all the views to space radially
